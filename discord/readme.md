# how to discord status

this is kinda stupidly made since i'm broke and can't actually afford a proper hosting service
anyway

## remember to uncomment the code plz

make discord application
make it a discord bot
go to glitch.com and make a new node project
copy the stuff from the .env.example in a normal .env file

you can setup uptimerobot or something to ocasionally ping the site so it doesn't immediately die (try every 2 minutes or so) and then just leave it running, you can know when the api is down since the discord bot we're about to create would be offline

oh and update the configuration file within the "./src/" folder
that's about it
