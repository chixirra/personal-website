      shortHistory: `I got into programming via Discord bots when i was 10, despite knowing nothing about
            it. I proudly made a simple bot using a lot of YouTube tutorials. Later, I learned
            coding through trial and error, trying to make projects way beyond my skill level (iâ€™m
            sad to say i never saved them). From Discord bots, I moved on to building my own
            database system, learned basic HTML and CSS, and Minecraft servers too! I spent around
            3-4 years building Minecraft servers and even ran my own public server for a while,
            which actually earned me my first money online <span class="italic opacity-33">(yes i know it is not legal)</span>. After a break from all the gaming stuff, I
            learned JavaScript to build a personal API to help a community i was a part of at the
            time. <br> Watching dev logs inspired me to try game development, leading me to
            explore game art and music. While I didn't particularly do well in those areas, the
            learning process was very much enjoyable and rewarding to me, seeing my ideas come to
            life`,
